Log & Metric Integrity Test

This test verifies that output logs are truthful representations of simulation events.
It creates predictable events and verifies they are correctly logged.

Test Components:
1. Crash Test: Engineer guaranteed collision and verify logging
2. Metric Sanity Check: Run single vehicle at constant speed and verify avg_speed
