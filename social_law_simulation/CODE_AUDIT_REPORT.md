  Code Audit and Debugging Report

  1. Control Authority Test Result: FAIL
  2. Log and Metric Integrity Test Result:

  Crash Logging: PASS
  Metric Sanity Check: FAIL

  3. Overall Summary:
  The project implementation has fundamental issues with vehicle control authority and metric accuracy. While the cooperative
  policy logic is well-structured and the crash detection works correctly, there are critical problems that prevent proper
  functionality. The simulation terminates prematurely (after 3-4 steps), agents cannot effectively control vehicles, and
  speed metrics are inaccurate by over 1 m/s.
  4. Issues and Bugs Found:

  Issue #1: Control Authority Failure - Vehicle Non-Responsiveness

  Location: social_law_simulation/src/main.py:78-84, social_law_simulation/src/scenarios.py:136-191
  Severity: Critical
  Description of Problem: The custom agents (SelfishAgent, CooperativeAgent) cannot actually control the ego vehicle. The test
   script commands lane changes every 20 steps but no lane changes occur, and simulations terminate after only 3-4 steps
  instead of running for the configured duration.
  Root Cause and Violation: The populate_environment_with_agents() function attempts to replace highway-env's ego vehicle with
   custom agent objects, but this violates highway-env's architecture. Highway-env expects agents to provide actions through
  the step() method, not replace the vehicle objects themselves. This violates SRS FR2 and FR3 as agents cannot execute their
  policies.
  Suggested Fix:
  # In main.py, modify run_single_simulation():
  def run_single_simulation(env, agent_policy_func, config, metrics_collector, render=False):
      # Instead of replacing vehicles, use agent policy to generate actions
      obs, info = env.reset()

      for step in range(duration_steps):
          # Get action from agent policy function
          action = agent_policy_func(obs) if agent_policy_func else 1
          obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
          # ... rest of simulation logic

  Issue #2: Incorrect Agent Architecture - Inheritance from ControlledVehicle

  Location: social_law_simulation/src/policies/selfish_policy.py:14,
  social_law_simulation/src/policies/cooperative_policy.py:13
  Severity: High
  Description of Problem: Both SelfishAgent and CooperativeAgent inherit from ControlledVehicle, which is a highway-env
  vehicle class, not a policy class. This creates confusion between vehicle objects and decision-making policies.
  Root Cause and Violation: Misunderstanding of highway-env architecture. Agents should be policy functions or classes that
  return actions, not vehicle objects. This violates the separation of concerns between vehicle simulation and decision logic.
  Suggested Fix:
  # Create separate policy classes:
  class SelfishPolicy:
      def __init__(self, config=None):
          # Initialize IDM and MOBIL parameters
          pass

      def act(self, obs):
          # Return action index based on observation
          return action_index

  class CooperativePolicy(SelfishPolicy):
      def act(self, obs):
          # Check social law triggers first
          cooperative_action = self._check_social_laws(obs)
          if cooperative_action is not None:
              return cooperative_action
          return super().act(obs)

  Issue #3: Metric Calculation Inaccuracy

  Location: social_law_simulation/src/metrics.py:78-85, social_law_simulation/src/metrics.py:266-267
  Severity: Medium
  Description of Problem: The MetricsCollector records speeds from all vehicles in the environment (including non-controlled
  vehicles) rather than just tracking the controlled agent's performance. This leads to inaccurate average speed calculations
  that don't reflect the agent's actual behavior.
  Root Cause and Violation: The speed collection logic in collect_step_metrics() extends all vehicle speeds to speed_history,
  diluting the agent's actual performance with background vehicle speeds. This violates the accuracy requirement for metrics
  reporting.
  Suggested Fix:
  # In collect_step_metrics(), only track ego vehicle:
  def collect_step_metrics(self, env, step_num):
      road = env.unwrapped.road
      vehicles = road.vehicles

      if vehicles:
          # Only track ego vehicle (first vehicle) for agent performance
          ego_vehicle = vehicles[0]
          if hasattr(ego_vehicle, 'speed') and not getattr(ego_vehicle, 'crashed', False):
              self.speed_history.append(ego_vehicle.speed)

  Issue #4: Observation Space Mismatch Warning

  Location: Throughout simulation (highway-env observation system)
  Severity: Low
  Description of Problem: Gymnasium warns that observations returned by reset() and step() are not within the expected
  observation space, indicating potential configuration mismatches.
  Root Cause and Violation: The environment configuration in scenarios.py may not properly match the expected observation
  space parameters. While not breaking functionality, this indicates configuration inconsistencies.
  Suggested Fix:
  # In scenarios.py, ensure observation config matches highway-env expectations:
  highway_config = {
      "observation": {
          "type": "Kinematics",
          "vehicles_count": 15,
          "features": ["presence", "x", "y", "vx", "vy"],
          "features_range": {
              "x": [-100, 100],
              "y": [-100, 100],
              "vx": [-20, 20],
              "vy": [-20, 20]
          },
          "absolute": False,
          "order": "sorted",
          "normalize": True  # Add normalization
      }
  }

  Issue #5: Decentralization Compliance Verification Needed

  Location: social_law_simulation/src/policies/cooperative_policy.py:114-292
  Severity: Medium
  Description of Problem: While the cooperative policy appears to use only observation-based decision making, the social law
  implementations need verification that they don't inadvertently use centralized information or communicate between agents.
  Root Cause and Violation: The cooperative merging, polite yielding, and phantom jam mitigation implementations correctly use
   only local observation data, maintaining decentralization compliance per SRS requirements. However, some heuristics (like
  lane change intent detection) are overly simplistic.
  Suggested Fix: The decentralization compliance is actually CORRECT - all decisions use only local observations from the obs
  parameter, which represents what the individual agent can perceive. No changes needed for decentralization, but detection
  heuristics could be improved for better social law effectiveness.
