1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for a software project that uses the highway-env simulation library. The goal is to develop and compare two types of agent behaviors in a decentralized traffic environment: one where agents act purely on self-interest (baseline) and one where agents follow a set of "social laws" designed to improve traffic flow and safety. The final output will be a comparative analysis demonstrating the quantitative effects of these social laws.

1.2 Project Scope
The project involves:

Implementing two distinct driving policies for agents within highway-env.
Setting up controlled simulation scenarios to test these policies.
Running simulations with varying compositions of agent types (e.g., 100% selfish, 100% cooperative, 50/50 mix).
Collecting and processing key performance metrics (safety, efficiency).
Generating a final report and visualizations that clearly compare the outcomes of the different simulation runs.
The project does not scope the development of a new physics engine or a graphical user interface (GUI). All work will be built upon the existing highway-env library and its visualization capabilities.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
SRS: Software Requirements Specification
Agent: An autonomous vehicle within the simulation.
Policy: The set of rules or model that dictates an agent's actions (acceleration, steering).
highway-env: The Python library used for the simulation. A multi-agent environment for autonomous driving.
IDM: Intelligent Driver Model. A common car-following model for simulating human-like driving.
TTC: Time-to-Collision. A safety metric indicating the time remaining until two vehicles collide if they maintain their current velocities.
Social Law: A pre-defined cooperative rule that an agent follows, even if it may temporarily conflict with its own goal of maximizing speed.
Baseline Agent: An agent that does not follow social laws. Also referred to as the "Selfish Agent".
Cooperative Agent: An agent that follows the implemented social laws.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
This project is a self-contained simulation study. The resulting software will be a research tool used to execute traffic experiments and produce data-driven conclusions about the effects of cooperative driving behaviors.

2.2 Product Functions
The software will:

Define and instantiate two types of driving agents: "Selfish" and "Cooperative".
Configure and run simulations in pre-defined highway-env scenarios.
Allow the user to specify the ratio of Selfish vs. Cooperative agents for a given run.
Automatically record metrics on traffic efficiency, safety, and stability during each simulation.
At the end of a batch of simulations, generate a summary data file (e.g., CSV) and plots comparing the results.
2.3 Operating Environment
Language: Python 3.8+
Core Libraries:
highway-env
gymnasium (or gym)
numpy
pandas (for data processing)
matplotlib or seaborn (for plotting)
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
All agent logic must be implemented within the highway-env framework, likely by creating custom agent policies that subclass or replace the default ones.
The system must be executable via a command-line script.
The definitions of "social laws" must be explicitly coded as rules or cost function modifications; complex machine learning (e.g., training a new RL model from scratch) is not required unless used to codify these rules.
3. Specific Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements
The system shall initialize a highway-env environment. The specific environment configuration (e.g., number of lanes, agent density) will be determined by the simulation scenario (see FR4).

The system shall implement a baseline agent policy with the following characteristics:

Primary Goal: Maximize forward velocity without causing a collision.
Car-Following: Use the standard Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for longitudinal (forward/backward) control.
Lane Changing:
Lane changes are initiated only for personal gain (e.g., the target lane is faster).
A lane change is executed only if it is deemed safe from a purely physical standpoint (no immediate collision risk).
The agent will not slow down to accommodate other agents or create gaps for them. It will treat other agents as dynamic obstacles.
The system shall implement a cooperative agent policy that extends the baseline policy with the following "social laws":

FR3.1: Cooperative Merging:
Trigger: When a Cooperative agent on the highway detects another agent in a merging lane attempting to enter its lane ahead.
Action: If there is insufficient space for the merging agent, the Cooperative agent shall moderately decelerate to increase the gap, allowing for a safe and smooth merge. The goal is to avoid forcing the merging agent to brake hard or stop.
FR3.2: Polite Yielding for Lane Changes:
Trigger: When a Cooperative agent detects an adjacent agent signaling a lane change to move in front of it.
Action: The Cooperative agent shall slightly reduce its speed to create a safe gap for the other agent to complete its lane change, assuming this does not create a critical safety hazard.
FR3.3: Phantom Jam Mitigation:
Trigger: When traffic density ahead of the Cooperative agent exceeds a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 40 vehicles/km/lane).
Action: The agent shall increase its desired time headway (the T parameter in IDM) from the default (e.g., 1.5s) to a larger value (e.g., 2.0s). This creates a larger buffer, absorbs speed variations, and helps prevent stop-and-go waves.
The system shall be capable of running two distinct scenarios:

Scenario A: Highway Driving: A multi-lane (e.g., 4 lanes) straight highway with a continuous inflow of vehicles. This scenario is for testing general traffic flow and lane-changing behaviors.
Scenario B: Merge Ramp: A highway with a lane merging into it. This scenario is critical for testing the "Cooperative Merging" (FR3.1) and "Polite Yielding" (FR3.2) social laws.
For each scenario, simulations must be run with different agent compositions:

Run 1: 100% Selfish Agents
Run 2: 100% Cooperative Agents
Run 3: 50% Selfish, 50% Cooperative Agents
For each simulation run, the system must log the following metrics:

Efficiency Metrics:
Average speed of all agents across the simulation.
Total number of vehicles that complete their route (throughput).
Safety Metrics:
Total number of collisions.
Average Time-to-Collision (TTC) for near-miss events (e.g., when TTC < 2 seconds).
Stability Metrics:
Standard deviation of accelerations. Higher values indicate more aggressive, less smooth driving.
Cooperation Metrics (for Scenario B):
Merge success rate (percentage of merging vehicles that successfully enter the highway without stopping).
Upon completion of all simulation runs, the system shall:

FR6.1: Generate a Summary Data File: Produce a single CSV or JSON file that aggregates the metrics from FR5 for each scenario and agent composition. The file should be clearly structured, with columns for scenario, percent_cooperative, avg_speed, collisions, etc.
FR6.2: Generate Comparison Plots: Automatically generate and save image files for the following plots:
Bar chart: Average Speed vs. Agent Composition (for each scenario).
Bar chart: Total Collisions vs. Agent Composition (for each scenario).
Bar chart: Standard Deviation of Acceleration vs. Agent Composition (for each scenario).
3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
The main simulation parameters must be easily configurable without changing the source code. This includes:

Simulation duration (number of steps).
Number of simulation runs to average over.
Agent density/spawn rate.
Key parameters of the social laws (e.g., time headway T for FR3.3).
This should be handled via a configuration file (e.g., config.yaml) or command-line arguments.
The simulations should run in a reasonable amount of time. A single simulation run of 1000 steps with ~50 agents should complete in under 5 minutes on a modern desktop computer.

The code must be well-commented, particularly the logic for the agent policies (FR2, FR3).
The code should be modular. The policies for the Selfish and Cooperative agents must be implemented in separate classes or functions to ensure they are distinct and easy to manage.
